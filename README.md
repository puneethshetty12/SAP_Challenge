## Location Based Notifications
Using addProximityAlert of LocationManager. Proximity alert is removed when the memo is checked.

Note: During the implementation, I noticed that while switching from "Show open" to "Show all" and when there are checked notification in the database, the unchecked notification are checked automatically. I tried to debug it and fix it, somehow I could not figure out if the database response it wrong or if it occurs while refreshing the adapter.
